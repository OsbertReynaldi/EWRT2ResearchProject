            <p class="body-text" >Specific mental health issues are difficult to identify. Since the brain is such an organ of mystery, every psychiatrist or every doctor would most likely have varying opinions as to what exactly a person is struggling with. If it is a character like Arthur Fleck, could it be narcissistic personality disorder? Antisocial Personality disorder? Schizophrenia? A combination of all 3? Or something entirely different? <br><br>
              In today’s world, experts do not bring up these psychological illnesses randomly. There is a manual called the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), published by the American Psychiatric Association that assists in these identifications. <br><br>
              Through a personal analysis of specific scenes and dialogue from the movie using the DSM-5, Arthur Fleck’s mental health issues can be further identified from another perspective. This will either confirm or provide a new diagnosis to a character who’s psychological illnesses were never specified except for his pseudobulbar affect which caused him to laugh uncontrollably. <br><br>

            <p class="body-text" >Fleck has a wide variety of traits that make him potentially diagnosable with a variety of disorders. The DSM-5 description for Narcissistic Personality Disorder states that the person has an “overinflated and unjustified sense of self-importance and preoccupied with fantasies of success.” (Spielman et al, 612) This can be evidently seen when Fleck imagines himself as being the centre of attention in a comedy show; imagining his success. This trait can also be seen in the scenes where his neighbour is involved. Throughout the movie, we learn that he is infatuated with his neighbour Sophie as he goes on dates and gets involved in all sorts of situations. However, it is later shown that these were just part of his imagination. All of his desires for success, love, and power manifested into an overly powerful mental image, not reality. This part of his narcissistic personality disorder more resembles the situation in real modern society. Narcissism often doesn’t lead to violence however, it leads to a twisted sense of the world around them and a multiplicity of fantasies raging in their heads. <br><br>

              <p>Jiang, Emma. “'Joker': The Study of a Man Who Has Lost His Mind.” The Paly Voice, 7 Feb. 2020, https://palyvoice.com/153136/culture/entertainment/joker-the-study-of-a-man-who-has-lost-his-mind/. </p>
            </div>
            <p class="body-text" >In <i>Psychology 2e</i>, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (or PTSD) is defined according to DSM-5 as,  <br><br></p>
            <p class="block-cite body-text ml-5" >“experiencing a profoundly traumatic event leads to a constellation of symptoms that include intrusive and distressing memories of the event, avoidance of stimuli connected to the event, negative emotional states, feelings of detachment from others, irritability, proneness toward outbursts, hypervigilance, and a tendency to startle easily; these symptoms must occur for at least one month” (Spielman et al, 620) <br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text" >Since childhood, Fleck had been physically and psychologically abused by his mother. This physcial abuse resulted in head trauma which is the root cause of his pseudo bulbar affect and his social inability as an adult. The psychological abuse and neglect is what causes him to have detachment from others seeing as how he feels no empathy and is not able to form connections with other people. His proneness toward outbursts also support this diagnosis. In the later parts of the movie, it is highlighted that he starts to kill people that he deems awful; people who hack at his mental throne. <br><br>
              Again, this is an important issue in modern society highlighted by the movie’s protagonist. PTSD, especially through early childhood trauma, is a hidden epidemic in society as it is very difficult to identify. As Fleck writes down in the movie, “The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don’t.”(Phillips and Silver) This note that is visible in the movie heavily applies to modern society and it is the reason as to why mental illnesses like trauma are difficult to identify. The public is still uncomfortable with the idea of psychological abnormalities that people who have them try to hide it so that they can be accepted into society as ‘normal’ people. Furthermore, this concealment added to the fact that it is difficult to get treatment and therapy for these illnesses makes this all the more dangerous. It further puts a mental strain and pressure on the mentally struggling which accelerates their descent into a mental breakdown. <br><br>
              This happens a lot in society and sometimes, it even leads to actions like suicide. What this movie is trying to tell the audience with Fleck having PTSD, is that people should be more considerate of other people. It is unknown what someone has been through if they don’t tell you and sometimes saying or doing the wrong things can accelerate a person’s descent into darkness much like what Fleck had been through. From bullying, being ostracised, being abused, and neglected, all of this accelerates his downfall. <br><br>

          <div class="col-xl-12">
            <h2 class="analysisHeader" >Antisocial Personality Disorder</h2>
            <p class="body-text" >As previously explained in effects, Arthur Fleck does seem to have Antisocial Personality Disorder. In <i>Psychology 2e</i>, this disorder is defined according to DSM-5 as,<br><br></p>
            <p class="block-cite body-text ml-5" >“often lies, fights, and has problems with the law; impulsive and fails to think ahead; can be deceitful and manipulative in order to gain profit or pleasure; irresponsible and often fails to hold down a job or pay financial debts; lacks feelings for others and remorse over misdeeds” (Spielman et al, 620)<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text" >Although this description of Antisocial Personality Disorder might seem heavy, this disorder in society is commonly treated as normal, and being ‘introverted’. This is mostly because ‘antisocial’ is now most commonly used as an adjective. It’s severity is not recognised by the general public and it is not treated as a disorder by most people. What is dangerous about this disorder, is that it has extreme cases. When a person doesn’t interact with the rest of society for a prolonged period of time, they might have a twisted or incorrectly perceived image of society. Their mentality might be influenced by this image and result in them doing actions unfavourable to the people around them. This is exactly what happens with Arthur Fleck. His inability to connect with people and form bonds creates a mental image in his mind catered to his longings for romantic bonds and companionship. <br><br>

            <p class="body-text" ><br><br> An interesting aspect of the public’s reception towards the movie, is that it is mixed as seen from the 2 pie charts above. Metacritic (top) gives it a metascore of 59% whereas Rotten Tomatoes (bottom) gives it a tomatometer score of 68%. There seems to be a percentage of the audience who dislike <i>Joker</i> and as stated in the survey done by Zach Goins, “Not sure I liked “Joker” as much as I expected to, but that may just be because of how unsettled I feel. The Phoenix hype is justified — a terrifyingly brilliant 	performance. More character study than comic book, it’s a provocative and disturbingly human examination of empathy.” (Goins) Most, if not everyone, agrees that Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing portrayal of a mentally unstable man. However, what people disliked was the unsettling feeling they got after they had watched a supposedly insane man on the big screen. Most of the American public are still uncomfortable with the idea of mental health problems and this is a huge part of the problem. Due to this discomfort, people do not want to see mentally ill people in public displaying their symptoms and actions. People are so used to normality that, they do not care enough to educate themselves about other people’s sufferings.
              <br><br></p>
            <p class="block-cite body-text ml-5" >“Beyond my desire for a completely different story structure, I wish there was significantly less origin story nonsense – I don’t care about Arthur’s parents, nor do I care about his tenuous connection to the Wayne family. A slower build to psychopathy + fewer DC references = better movie. Also: tone down the musical score, guys.” (qtd. in Goins)
              <br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text" >It is highlighted from this survey that the public would rather have a slower buildup to psychopathy than the actual psychopathy. People are are more interested in how it happens rather than what happens. This is another representation of the problem with the American public. People care more about the factors and progress, and they do not want to deal with the consequences of their actions. This happens in scenarios such as child abuse which is also portrayed in the <i>Joker</i>. Parents who do not care about what they are inflicting on their children most likely would not want to deal with the consequences later on. Much like how Arthur is obliged to take care of his sick mother while he himself is deranged, most mentally ill children in the real world also have to try hide theirs in order be accepted by their parents.

            </div>
            <p class="body-text">
              Another cause for his insanity relates to the personality theory of Sigmund Freud. <br><br>
              He states that, “The unconscious id contains our most primitive drives or urges, and is present from birth.” (Spielman et al, 384) which are impulses for things like hunger, thirst and sex. As we know in psychology, these desires are satisfied through biological mechanisms to create a sense of pleasure. 
              <br><br>He defines the superego as “our conscience; it is our moral compass that tells us how we should behave.” (Spielman et al, 385) And thus through the superego, we begin to feel feelings of pride and guilt. 
              <br><br>Lastly, there is the ego. “Its job is to balance the demands of the id and superego in the context of reality; thus, it operates on what Freud called the “reality principle.” The ego helps the id satisfy its desires in a realistic way” (Spielman et al 385)
              <br><br>Throughout the movie, Arthur Fleck’s id is filled with negative thoughts and urges. This is said by the character himself during a consultation with his psychiatrist. "All I have are negative thoughts. But you don't listen anyway.” (Phillips and Silver) We can see him satisfy these urges in multiple scenes throughout the movie; most notable, the scene where he kills Franklin Murray. He can be seen laughing and feeling a sense of pleasure as he realizes what he has just done.
              <br><br>Fleck’s superego, or moral compass, is twisted which is what causes his violent outbursts and actions. Due to his narcissistic and antisocial personality disorder, he deems everyone who belittles him and the things he cares about to be awful; and to Fleck, being an awful person means you deserve to be killed. Due to this though, he doesn’t kill everybody he dislikes. As long as they have not done anything wrong to him he would not have a problem with the person. This is exampled by the scene where he kills Randal and not Gary even though he kills Randal in front of Gary. Gary “did not have any problems with Arthur. He was a good person. So, Arthur let him go.” (Fitriani 126) Although his superego and moral compass is twisted, it is not entirely wrong.
              <br><br>Since the ego satisfies desires and urges in a realistic way, with a twisted moral compass, this means something completely different in regards to Arthur Fleck. His ‘realistic’ way of dealing with his negative emotions is through violence and taking the lives of others. The id, and superego are working in tandem rather than counteracting each other which leads to his ego losing its original purpose of being ‘realistic’ and lawful. <br><br>

            <h2 class="analysisHeader" >Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="body-text" >The dark reality of mental health is brought to life through <i>Joker</i> and its main protagonist, Arthur Fleck. The hints of different psychological flaws spread throughout the movie makes this piece of filmography an amazing symbolism and representation of reality. <br><br>
              Stephen T. Asma says in “Why We Still Need Monsters”, “A lot of them agree that when a group feels under threat and their basic needs are not being met, a really charismatic, tyrannical person rises to the top.” (qtd. in Berger) With Arthur Fleck being seen as a monster towards the end of the movie, he does fit this trope. He is seen as a symbol of hope for the people going against the society and higher ups of Gotham; a really charismatic, and tyrannical person. <br><br>
              Although not everything about <i>Joker</i> is accurate in terms of psychological causes and effects, it serves its purpose as a reminder to the public that they need to be more educated and support these people in need. This analysis begs the question, “How many more monsters are going to be created as a result of our flawed system?” <br><br>
