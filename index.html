                Even though <i>Joker</i> is a movie based on a superhero villain, it
                brilliantly portrays mental health struggles in modern society
                through Arthur Fleck's adversities and descent into madness.

                The portrayal of mental health through the movie <i>Joker</i> represents mental health in modern American society through symbolism, metaphors, and other comparison techniques. Previous research has highlighted the main character, Arthur Fleck's diagnosis and psychological struggles which include Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder and Pseudobulbar affect. The dominant claims of critics and researchers state that <i>Joker</i> offers a potentially misinformative portrayal of mental health struggles due to all the violence depicted in the movie. 
                Through qualitative data from surveys and quantitative data from ratings, the reaction of the American public can also be seen in which a majority of watchers agree that the portrayal of a mentally deranged character makes them unsettled and uncomfortable. 
                Contrary to what has already been researched, the movie does actually do an excellent job of representation. The counterarguments such as the correlation of violence with mental illness can be seen as a boon. This correlation represents the public's misinformation towards mental illness and serves as a message for the public to be further educated on this topic. Although <i>Joker</i> does have it's shortcomings, it does an overall amazing job at symbolic representation of the American modern society.

                <i>Joker</i> is a movie known for its amazing writing, script and director. It highlights and symbolises issues pertaining to real life problems in mental health through the main character, Arthur Fleck.
                His past and current activities as detailed in the plot of the movie shows the brutality of society towards people with mental health issues and also highlights the casues and effects of mental deterioration.
                Although the movie is set in the fictional city of Gotham, it is clearly a representation of 20th century New York City, depicting how dark those times were towards people of lower economic classes and people with mental health issues.
                Through analysing the causes and symptoms of Arthur Fleck's mental health problems based on past research as well as doing a personal deep dive on the movie, this research paper aims to analyse how exactly the movie depicts mental health in modern America.

                Modern America faces the problem of ignorance towards mental health. Most people are not educated about the causes of mental health problems and what exactly are mental health issues. What makes this problem worse, is that people generally do not seem to care.
                Past research has already highlighted how Arthur Fleck's character in <i>Joker</i> portrays the severity of mental illness. Although it is never specifically mentioned in the movie, past research has also managed to diagnose him with a few disorders through psychological theory.
                Critic reviews and surveys also show that <i>Joker</i> received mixed reviews from the public with an average of around 60% being fond of the movie due to the discomfort that this movie suposedly brings to its audience.
